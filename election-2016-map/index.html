          One of the troubles with effectively communicating election data is
          that many of the most readily obvious graphical approaches lead to
          visual distortion that you have to be
          <em>really motivated</em> if you're going to get rid of it, and when
          this distortion just happens to work in the favor of your particular
          political tribe, you're likely not exactly itching to do the extra
          work of fixing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's how you end of with several different visualizations that
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/30/presenting-the-least-misleading-map-of-the-2016-election/"
            >all purport to be showing you the same data</a
          >
          that somehow manage to lead you to wildly different conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take, for example, the infamous "impeach this" map of the 2016
          presidential election:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="svg-container">
        <svg id="svgChloro" class="svg-content"></svg>
      </div>
      <div class="narration">
        <p>
          This version (a "chloropleth") simply colors counties by their winner,
          and one like it was
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178989254309011456"
            >retweeted by Trump</a
          >
          in an apparent argument that he could not be impeached based on his
          overwhelming popular support. Twitter, as Twitter does, subsequently
          held a dunk contest on him demonstrating why the visualization was
          poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why exactly is it poor? Let's look at Nevada, for example. Clinton
          carried Nevada, 539,260 votes to 512,058.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="svg-container">
        <svg id="svgNevada" class="svg-content"></svg>
      </div>
      <div class="narration">
        <p>
          Even though Clinton won the state, Trump won 15 of the 17 individual
          counties, so the state is visually majority red. Naturally, this
          representation leads your eye to believe the state went overwhelmingly
          Republican, especially when the state is lost in the U.S. as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trouble is that the two counties Clinton won happen to be the two
          counties where the vast majority of people in Nevada live. Clark
          County (home to Las Vegas) has
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Nevada#By_county"
            >over twice the votes</a
          >
          of the rest of the state combined. The other county she won was
          Washoe, whose county seat is Reno.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can try to solve this by using circles placed at county centers and
          scaling them to the number of votes won:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="svg-container">
        <svg id="svgNevadaCircles" class="svg-content"></svg>
      </div>
      <div class="narration">
        <p>
          ...but this still has the unappealing property that only the winner's
          votes are shown on the map. For example, 81% of Trump's votes came
          from Clark and Washoe counties, and those votes aren't shown at all.
          He looks like he lost in a landslide when in fact he only lost by
          about 2.5% of the vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somehow, just by changing the style, we've managed to take the same
          data and steer it to the polar opposite conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the worst offense of winner-take-all style maps: in visually
          removing the loser completely, they falsely display areas as being
          more one-sided than they really are. They don't accurately depict the
          reality that most places have many people voting both ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, these sorts of representations help steer society towards
          beliefs that some places are "nothing but" one particular party, which
          is frequently not true in reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          People (and by extension, places) are nuanced, so we need an
          visualization that reflects that. One of the best visualizations of
          the 2016 election is this one by xkcd comic author Randall Munroe:
        </p>
      </div>
      <a target="blank" href="https://xkcd.com/1939/">
        <img
          class="image"
          height="600"
          width="960"
          src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2016_election_map_2x.png"
        />
      </a>
      <div class="narration">
        <p>
          Why is it great? It does the best job of showing where the masses of
          votes are while simultaneously communicating that entire states did
          not, in fact, vote completely in favor of any single candidate. It
          also avoids allocating color (which, to your eye, says "votes") to
          places where there are no people.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this representation comes at a cost: this map is hard to make. In
          particular, choosing where the markers should be placed is difficult.
          In Munroe's map, each marker accounts for 250,000 votes; in some
          states, a candidate might not have that many in the entire state. That
          means the votes for some markers (perhaps even <em>most</em> markers)
          must be coming from counties that are not necessarily close to it on
          the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's try to figure out how to make one like Munroe's. I don't know
          the method he used for his, but for mine, I concocted the following
          "algorithm" (a generous word, indeed):
        </p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>Choose a number of votes per marker on the map.</li>
          <li>
            Make a first pass over all counties in the state. For any counties
            with enough votes on their own for at least one marker, place the
            appropriate number of markers at the county center.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the remaining votes, traverse the counties adding their votes
            together. When traversing, we'll move "greedily", choosing the
            neighbor county that has the most votes available to try to form a
            marker as soon as possible. Once enough votes have been accumulated
            for a marker, draw it at the center of the
            <strong>merged</strong> shape of the counties from which the votes
            are coming from.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here's what the result of this process looks like for Nevada. The
          highlighted counties show which counties each marker is coming from
          when it's placed. I chose markers of 10,000 votes each.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="svg-container">
        <svg id="svgNevadaMarkersAnimated" class="svg-content"></svg>
      </div>
      <div class="narration">
        <p>
          As you can see, there's a trade-off between having markers that are
          representative of the location of their voters and accounting for as
          many votes in the state as possible. Some markers end up representing
          votes from counties that form a strange shape with one another, are
          far from the marker, or both. We have to choose between that and
          leaving votes unshown.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, this is a much better representation of Nevada's results.
          Visually, it's hard to even tell who won, as it should be when the
          margin was so small. We get the correct impression that Nevada was a
          mixed bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the results of the same method applied to the whole US. On this
          one, each marker represents 100,000 votes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="svg-container">
        <svg id="svgUSMarkers" class="svg-content"></svg>
      </div>
      <div class="narration">
        <p>
          ...and after about a billion times the code and elbow grease it took
          to make a minimum-effort chloropleth, we have a much better
          representation of what actually happened in 2016. Suddenly, many
          states looks much more heterogeneous than common opinion would have
          you believe.
